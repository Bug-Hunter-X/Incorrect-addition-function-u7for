# Incorrect addition function
This repository contains a JavaScript function with a bug and its solution.
The function `foo` is supposed to add two numbers, but it incorrectly returns 0 when either of the inputs is 0, and it has some unnecessary checks for 0 values.
The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code, and `bugSolution.js` contains the corrected version.
